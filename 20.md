Consequance: Make events a first-class citizen of your app

```js
function updateUserPreferences() {
  //...
  eventBus.emit({type: 'userPreferencesUpdated', payload: preferences})
}
```

Having “change” be encapsulated in a concrete object is a benefit in and of itself:

- Improved logging
- Improved semantics
