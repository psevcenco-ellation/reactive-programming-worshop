Events vs. Commands

- Names are one of the most important things in software
- Events just indicate a change without expecting any particular response
- Commands are telling some service what to do
- Commands are just glorified method calls and donâ€™t help you understand how module works
- Key insight: be wary of commands (ex. fetchSubgenres)
- Also be wary of events masquerading is command (ex. fetchCommentsStart)
