"A transformational system waits for all its inouts to arrive, carries out some precessing, and outputs the results when the processing is done"

"A reactive system continuously interacts with its environment, using inputs and outputs that are either continuous in time or ddescrete. The inputs and outputs are often asynchronous meaning that they may arrive or change values unpredictably at any point n time."
