Lazily getting a single value not readily available.

```js
import Task from 'data.task'
import usersDb from 'user-db'

const user = id => new Task((reject, resolve) => usersDb.getUser(id, user => resolve(user)))

const johnsRating = () => user(42).map(prop('rating')

console.log(johnsRating()) // Task(4.8)
```

Takeaway: Don't mix the execution of side-effects with the formulation of what you want
